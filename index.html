    <h1>Perfect Trip</h1>
      <p>
      The perfect trip right now would be the carribean. Laying on the beach or going into the pool all day and watching Netflix. It might get boring but I would enjoy it whike I could Not having to do homework, forgetting all about corona and just chilling. I would need wifi thought and some money to buy what I want.

       On my trip, I want to see different kinds of animals with different colors. I hope to try different types of food. I would start with oxtail, jerk chicken and curry.
